# Todd Fisher's Build an Apartment Project

This was a fun project. The hardest thing was figuring out how lighting works, and that there was no instant preview in some cases. After a few hours of taking a crack at it, I finally think I got it down.

I wrote 2 lines of C# and hope to write a whole lot more in upcomming assignments.

How long it took to complete the project.
